TODO
- Replace all template IDs with new IDs in all fields
- Add entries for projectile hit effect, and all other currency stones when writing to diff csvs
- Make sure the correct IDs are used when writing in the corresponding pdf
- Currency needs all the currenciy IDs
- Dragon attack and Projectile needs the fireball etc ID
- ParticleEffect needs imp_drg_DRAGONID_hit and _miss
- Swappable needs Egg? Is it ok to leave it empty for PMs?  
- Create upgrades file in dragon folder
- Find a way to copy over visual effects files in their respective folders. Simple file copy and rename from template?
- Change the way this writes to csvs, it should append data to template files instead of overwriting
